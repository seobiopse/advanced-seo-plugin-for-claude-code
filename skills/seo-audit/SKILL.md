# SEO / AEO / GEO Engineering Audit

## What this skill does

Three layers, treated as equally important:

1. **Classic SEO** — will search engines crawl, render, index, and rank this page?
2. **AEO** — will Google AI Overviews, Bing Copilot, and similar engines pull an answer from this page?
3. **GEO** — will ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini cite this page when asked a relevant question?

## When to use this skill

Trigger on any of:
- "Run an SEO / AEO / GEO / full audit on [URL or code]"
- "Check this page before we ship"
- "Is this ready to launch?"
- "Why isn't Google indexing this?"
- "Audit the schema on the product/article/job page"
- "Make sure we show up in AI Overviews / ChatGPT / Perplexity"
- "Review our Core Web Vitals"
- "Verify our robots.txt / sitemap / llms.txt"
- "Can Googlebot render this?"
- Anything mixing "engineering" + "search visibility"

If the request touches SEO/AEO/GEO even loosely, prefer this skill over answering from general knowledge. The skill produces a consistent, standardized, engineer-actionable report.

## The seven modes

| Mode | When to use | Reference | Command |
|---|---|---|---|
| **seo** | Full technical SEO: crawl, index, render, meta, schema, performance, on-page | `references/seo-audit.md` | `/seo-audit` |
| **aeo** | AI Overviews, featured snippets, voice answers | `references/aeo.md` | `/aeo-audit` |
| **geo** | ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini citation readiness | `references/geo.md` | `/geo-audit` |
| **vds** | Visibility-to-Demand System (VDS) framework: review mapping crawl visibility to conversion and authority metrics | `references/vds-audit.md` | `/vds-audit` |
| **agentic-browsing** | Agentic Browsing (SXO / AXO) readiness | `references/agentic-browsing.md` | `/agentic-browsing-audit` |
| **full** | All pillars in sequence (pre-ship sign-off) | All reference guides | `/full-audit` |
| **crawl-check** | Scoped to React/Next.js/SPA rendering — what each crawler actually sees | `references/crawlability-react.md` | `/crawl-check` |

## The two input methods

### Method A: Live URL via Chrome
Use when the page is reachable (including localhost / staging / prod).
- Navigate via Chrome browser tool.
- Capture rendered HTML, raw response headers (via `read_network_requests`), Core Web Vitals, full-page screenshot.
- Use `javascript_tool` to extract: `document.title`, meta tags, canonical, hreflang, robots, schema JSON-LD, headings tree, alt-text coverage, internal link count.
- Use `get_page_text` for rendered text (for AEO/GEO analysis).
- If Ahrefs is connected, enrich with `site-audit-issues` and `site-explorer-metrics`.

### Method B: Code snippet from localhost / git
Use when the engineer pastes HTML, a component, a template, or a route-handler output.
- Analyze the code directly — no Chrome needed.
- Ask for associated `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and HTTP response headers if the mode needs them.
- For framework code (React / Next.js / Angular / Vue / Nuxt / Astro / SvelteKit / PHP / etc.), consider rendering implications. Flag any SEO-critical content that only renders client-side.

## How to run an audit

### Step 0 — Domain discovery (MANDATORY, do this FIRST every time)

**Read `references/domain-discovery.md` BEFORE loading any other reference file or starting any audit work.**

Not every domain has the same shape. A staffing subdomain has `JobPosting`. A bootcamp has `Course`. A marketing site has `Service`. A blog has `Article`. A documentation site has `TechArticle`. An e-commerce site has `Product`. Applying checks that don't fit the domain produces noise findings — flagging missing `JobPosting` schema on a blog, or missing `Course` schema on a pricing page. Noise findings erode trust in the plugin.

**Detect the domain archetype using:**
1. User intent (if they framed it — "audit my blog" vs "audit our recruitment site")
2. URL patterns (`/jobs/`, `/courses/`, `/blog/`, `/pricing`, `/docs/`, `/products/`…)
3. Schema types already present (`JobPosting` vs `Course` vs `Article` vs `Product`)
4. Homepage H1 + first paragraph content signals
5. Top-nav structure

**If you can't classify within 30 seconds, ASK the user.** A wrong archetype produces worse findings than a quick clarifying question.

**Based on the archetype, decide:**
- Which deep-dive references to LOAD
- Which deep-dive references to EXPLICITLY SKIP (and mention what you skipped in the report so the user can verify)
- Which scoring rubric applies (Landing/Money vs Blog/Article)

**Output the detected archetype prominently** in the audit's `overview` field AND as a scorecard entry in `summary.scorecard` — with a line like `"Detected archetype: Staffing services — no course/event/product checks applied"`. This transparency lets the user correct a misclassification before reading findings.

See `references/domain-discovery.md` Section 3 for the per-archetype audit-scope mapping (10 common archetypes covered: Marketing, Blog, E-commerce, SaaS, Job board, Staffing services, Course platform, Documentation, Multi-product conglomerate, Personal site).

### Step 1: Clarify scope
If mode or input method isn't specified, ask (one AskUserQuestion call).

### Step 2: Detect stack and load the relevant reference file(s)
`Read` the reference(s) that match BOTH (a) the mode the user picked AND (b) the archetype you detected in Step 0. For `full` mode, read `seo-audit.md`, `aeo.md`, AND `geo.md` PLUS archetype-appropriate deep-dives. Always read `issue-framework.md` before writing findings.

**Detect the tech stack** from URL patterns, response headers, page source signals, and user context, then load the matching stack profile:

| Stack signals | Load |
|---|---|
| `React`, `Next.js`, App Router, `_next/`, `__NEXT_DATA__`, Remix, Gatsby | `react-nextjs-architecture-profile.md` |
| `WordPress`, `wp-content/`, `wp-json`, `WooCommerce` | `wordpress-architecture-profile.md` |
| `Shopify`, `myshopify.com`, `/collections/`, `/products/` prefix, Liquid | `shopify-architecture-profile.md` |
| Eleventy, Jekyll, Hugo, Astro, `_site/`, `public/` static output, GitHub Pages | `static-html-architecture-profile.md` |
| Angular, `ng-version`, `<app-root>`, Angular Universal | `angular-architecture-profile.md` |
| PHP, Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter, `composer.json`, `artisan` | `php-architecture-profile.md` |
| Wix, `x-wix-request-id`, Webflow, `.webflow.io`, Framer, Squarespace | `wix-webflow-architecture-profile.md` |

If the stack is unclear or mixed, load the most likely profile and note the uncertainty in the audit. If no stack profile matches, proceed with the universal checklist only.

Also load deep-dives when context calls for them:
- React / Next.js / SPA → `crawlability-react.md`
- Schema beyond basics → `structured-data-advanced.md`
- AI-assisted content → `ai-content-safety.md`
- Any `/jobs/` URL or job board → `pseo-playbook.md`

### Step 3: Gather data
Collect what the checklists require. For live URLs, in parallel: rendered HTML + raw HTML, headers, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `llms.txt`, screenshot, JSON-LD blocks, meta tags, OpenGraph, Twitter cards, hreflang, canonical, H1/H2/H3 tree, alt-text coverage, internal link count, page weight, request count.

### Step 4: Work through the checklist
For each item, decide `pass` / `warn` / `fail`. Every `warn` and `fail` becomes an issue. Don't invent issues outside the checklist — if you notice something real not on the list, include it as an "additional finding" but keep most findings aligned to the checklist so results are comparable across audits.

### Step 5: Write findings using the issue framework
Use `references/issue-framework.md` exactly. Each issue MUST include: severity badge (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info), pillar tags (SEO/AEO/GEO — one to three), summary, why flagged (with standards reference), impact bullets (SEO/AEO/GEO — all three, even if "no direct impact"), benefits, broken code, fixed code, how to verify.

### Step 6: Generate both reports
Output paths (use the workspace folder the engineer shares, default to `/mnt/Core Tickets/` or the current project folder):
- `seo-audit-{mode}-{date}.md`
- `seo-audit-{mode}-{date}.html`

Preferred: call `scripts/generate_report.py --input findings.json --output-dir <dir>`.
Fallback: fill in `assets/report-template.md` and `assets/report-template.html` manually.

The HTML report includes (automatically, no configuration required):
- **Audit-group section dividers** — Traditional SEO / LLM Visibility banners when `audit_group` is set on findings.
- **Per-page context** — each finding card shows the page it applies to (via `page` or `pages_affected`).
- **Interactive checklist** — every finding has a "Mark as addressed" checkbox. Progress persists per-report in localStorage.
- **Progress bar** — sticky under the TOC, shows `X of N addressed`.
- **Re-run panel** — appears at the bottom once all findings are marked addressed, with suggested commands.
- **Signature band** — "Crafted with care by Giriish · Father of SEO · Want to colaborate" (linked to Telegram at http://t.me/spcgbot).

### Step 6b: Compute scores (for `/full-audit` and on explicit request)

When running `/full-audit`, also produce two numeric grades:

1. **SEO Quality Score (0–100)** — run the rubric in `seo-quality-score-rubric.md`. Detect page type (Landing/Money vs Blog/Article) from URL + schema + content. Score each of: LSI term coverage, semantic variants, named entities, content depth, sentiment alignment, keyword targeting discipline, trust signal density (for Landing/Money) OR readability (for Blog/Article).

2. **E-E-A-T Score (0–100)** — run the rubric in `eeat-score-rubric.md`. Score each pillar (Experience / Expertise / Authoritativeness / Trust) with its sub-signals. Weights differ by page type (Trust is 35/100 on Landing/Money but 20/100 on Blog/Article; Experience is 30/100 on Blog/Article but 25/100 on Landing/Money).

Both scores include a `top_improvements` list — 2–3 specific changes that would raise the score most. These are added to the JSON under `scores.seo_quality` and `scores.eeat`. The generator renders them as visual scorecards at the top of the HTML report.

**Rules:**
- Score ONE representative page per template — not every page. Scoring 50 pages produces noise.
- Never fabricate sub-signals. If a signal isn't on the page, score 0.
- Score the PAGE, not the brand.
- Skip scoring on `/crawl-check` mode and on code-only audits.

### Step 7: Summarize for the user
3–6 sentences: what was audited, total findings by severity, **both scores (Quality + E-E-A-T)**, top 3 urgent issues by name, `computer://` links to both reports.

## Severity definitions

- **Critical** — Page is effectively invisible or broken (noindex shipped, robots blocking, 5xx, missing `<title>`, server content hidden from bots).
- **High** — Significant SEO/AEO/GEO value lost (missing canonical/H1, no schema on eligible page, CWV well below thresholds).
- **Medium** — Measurable but recoverable (thin meta description, missing OpenGraph, inconsistent heading hierarchy, no author schema).
- **Low** — Polish (title slightly long, minor alt-text gaps, missing favicon variants).
- **Info** — Not a defect but worth documenting.

## Things this skill should NOT do

- Don't guess rankings or traffic impact as hard numbers.
- Don't provide generic marketing advice. Fixes must be code-level where possible.
- Don't re-run crawls if the user already provided data.
- Don't skip the three-pillar impact breakdown. If a pillar isn't affected, say so.
- Don't fabricate "broken code" you didn't actually see. Mark "needs input" instead.

### Intent detection — URL-level signals (after archetype is set)

URL-level intent detection is still useful ONCE the domain archetype has been established via Step 0. These rules apply WITHIN an archetype for per-page targeting:

- **URL contains `/blog/`, `/article/`, `/guide/`, `/docs/`, `/learn/`** → informative content; load `aeo.md`, `geo.md`, `ai-overview-playbook.md`, `llm-citation-playbook.md`.
- **URL contains `/pricing`, `/plans`, or is a landing page with hero + CTA + form** → transaction content; load `transaction-intent-playbook.md`, `aeo-transaction.md`, `geo-transaction.md`.
- **URL contains `/jobs/`, `/careers/`, `/job-detail`** → PSEO jobs; load `pseo-playbook.md` Part A — **only if archetype is Job board or Staffing services**.
- **URL contains `/courses/`, `/programs/`, `/certifications/`** → PSEO courses; load `pseo-playbook.md` Part B — **only if archetype is Course platform / bootcamp**.
- **URL contains `/events/`** → PSEO events; load `pseo-playbook.md` Part C — **only if events are a real product surface**.
- **URL contains `/skill-assessments/`, `/quiz/`, `/assessments/`** → PSEO skill assessments; load `pseo-playbook.md` Part D — **only if assessments are a product surface**.
- **URL has explicit city/ICP in path (e.g., `/whitefield/`, `/schools/`)** → generated landing page; load `pseo-playbook.md` Part E.

**Critical rule:** URL patterns can be misleading. A SaaS site might have `/jobs` meaning "job to be done" rather than "job postings." The ARCHETYPE determines which rules apply. Always let Step 0 override URL-level pattern matching.

For `/full-audit`, load all relevant deep-dives based on BOTH the archetype AND the per-page URL intent.
