# SEO Audit Plugin for Claude Code

**Production-ready v1.8.0** — a Claude Code plugin that runs comprehensive SEO, AEO (Answer Engine Optimization), and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) audits on **any website, any stack**. Produces ticket-ready Markdown reports and interactive HTML reports with before/after code, confidence scores, interactive checklists, and quantitative scoring. Fully optimized for Agentic Browsing (SXO / AXO).

## Why this plugin exists

SEO audits are mostly the same work, done badly, over and over, by every team. Engineers either skip SEO entirely (shipping invisible pages) or drown in 200-item checklists they can't triage. Marketing teams hand over audit spreadsheets that don't connect to code. Meanwhile, the rules have gotten more complex — Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT citations, Perplexity source cards, Claude web search, Gemini, Bing Copilot each need different signals.

This plugin fixes that by:

1. **Codifying a production-grade checklist** across 35 reference files covering every major SEO/AEO/GEO pillar.
2. **Adapting to YOUR site's stack and architecture** — it detects whether you're on React/Next.js, WordPress, Shopify, static HTML, Angular, PHP, Wix/Webflow, or any other platform, then loads the matching stack profile.
3. **Adapting to YOUR site's archetype** — it detects whether you're a blog, SaaS, e-commerce, job board, bootcamp, docs site, or multi-product conglomerate, and tailors the audit scope accordingly.
4. **Producing engineer-actionable reports** — every finding has confidence scores, evidence sources, broken-code-vs-fixed-code examples, and a verification step.
5. **Quantifying quality** with two 0–100 scoring models — SEO Quality (NLP-driven: LSI, semantic, entities, sentiment) and E-E-A-T (Google's Search Quality Rater Guidelines).
6. **Enforcing governance** so extensions go through review, not ad-hoc edits.

## Is this plugin right for you?

**Yes if:**
- Your team uses Claude Code for development.
- You have at least one web property to audit — any architecture (React / Next.js / WordPress / Shopify / Wix / Webflow / static HTML / Angular / PHP / etc.).
- You want a repeatable, standards-based SEO / AEO / GEO audit workflow.
- You want engineering to own technical SEO, and marketing to own strategy.

**Probably not if:**
- You need automated daily crawling with dashboards (use Ahrefs / Semrush / Screaming Frog for that).
- You want a drop-in audit UI for non-technical users (this one requires the Claude Code CLI).

## Universal stack coverage

The plugin auto-detects your tech stack and loads the matching architecture profile:

| Stack | Profile loaded |
|---|---|
| React, Next.js (App Router / Pages Router), Remix, Gatsby | `react-nextjs-architecture-profile.md` |
| WordPress, WooCommerce | `wordpress-architecture-profile.md` |
| Shopify, Shopify Plus | `shopify-architecture-profile.md` |
| Eleventy, Jekyll, Hugo, Astro, plain HTML/CSS | `static-html-architecture-profile.md` |
| Angular, Angular Universal, Ionic | `angular-architecture-profile.md` |
| PHP, Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter | `php-architecture-profile.md` |
| Wix, Webflow, Framer, Squarespace | `wix-webflow-architecture-profile.md` |

The core audit methodology (SEO/AEO/GEO checklists, scoring, issue framework) is stack-agnostic. Stack profiles add platform-specific checks on top.

## Quick start

### Installation (end users)

If your team has published this plugin to a marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add <org>/<repo>
/plugin install seo-audit
```

Or install from a local clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seobiopse/advanced-seo-plugin-for-claude-code
# In Claude Code:
/plugin install <path-to-cloned-repo>
```

### Your first audit

In Claude Code:

```
/full-audit https://your-domain.com/
```

Claude asks a few clarifying questions, detects your site's archetype and stack, and produces two files in your workspace folder:

- `seo-audit-<mode>-<date>.html` — interactive HTML report
- `seo-audit-<mode>-<date>.md` — Markdown for tickets

Open the HTML. Tick off findings as you ship fixes. A "Ready to re-run" panel appears when you've addressed every finding.

### Six slash commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/seo-audit` | Full technical SEO audit (~80 checks) |
| `/aeo-audit` | Answer-Engine Optimization (AI Overviews, featured snippets) |
| `/geo-audit` | Generative-Engine Optimization (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, Copilot) |
| `/agentic-browsing-audit` | Agentic Browsing / SXO / AXO readiness audit (AI browser navigation) |
| `/full-audit` | All pillars + scoring + comprehensive deep-dives |
| `/crawl-check` | Fast 14-check rendering-only audit for React/Next.js/SPA sites |

## Architecture principles

### 1. Stack-aware, not stack-specific

The plugin detects your stack and loads the matching profile. The core methodology (crawl, index, schema, AEO, GEO) is universal — stack profiles add platform-specific checks on top, not replace the fundamentals.

### 2. Site-architecture-driven, not client-specific

The plugin reasons about domains via their architecture archetype (marketing / blog / SaaS / job board / etc.), not by name. No hardcoded rules for any specific brand.

### 3. Checklist + scoring, not opinion

Every finding is tied to a standard — Google Search Central, schema.org, RFC, web.dev, WCAG, OpenAI crawler docs, Anthropic crawler docs. Severity is calibrated against documented best practice.

### 4. Engineer-actionable

Every finding has broken-code and fixed-code examples, tied to the specific file or template they apply to. Every fix has a concrete verification step.

### 5. Governance

Engineers don't edit the plugin directly. Changes go through Marketing Director / AVP / Manager review via the `NEW-CHECK-REQUEST-TEMPLATE.md` form. Maintainer has sole commit access. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
